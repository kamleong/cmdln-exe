A single line command launcher inspired by [Bayden's SlickRun](http://www.bayden.com/slickrun/)

cmdln-exe is currently lack of user documentation, and is more meant for junior programmers to explore and learn from the source code.

TIPS: you can actually create your own shortcuts and save it in cmdln.ini

e.g.
```
[shortcuts]
ie     = ""%ProgramFiles%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" about:blank"
gmail  = https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=html
uninst = rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL appwiz.cpl
```
